# Instagram Presence

A simple extension to show what you are coding in your Instagram notes. This extension is heavily inspired by the [Discord Presence](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=icrawl.discord-vscode) extension.

### Short Overview

With this extension you can enable (and disable) showing the current file you are editing in Visual Studio Code on your Instagram Note. 

### Source Code 

To see how the extension was made, feel free to check out the [repository](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=icrawl.discord-vscode). Please do not hesitate to email [me](mailto:anish.lakkapragada@yale.edu) if you have any questions.

*This extension does ask directly for the user's Instagram username and password. This is because [Instagram's Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api) does not permit updating a user's notes.*
